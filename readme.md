## Simple Tictactoe with Java  

I created this for [Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48?track=8) from [Java for Beginners Track](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/8) of [Jetbrain Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/).  

You can compile and run the program and keep entering two integers for coordinates on 3x3 grid to play the game until the winner is determined or it is filled with moves of 'X' or 'O'.  

The coordinates are row and column numbers; row first.

##### Example  

Enter the coordinates: 2 3
